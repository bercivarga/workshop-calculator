# Workshop Calculator Project

Hey guys!

Welcome to Week 4's assignment.

If you open up `index.html`, you'll see a beautiful calculator in your browser.

You're already a master of `css` and `html`, so this time your task is to give life to this calculator by adding some `javascript` ~magic~.

Your goal is to have a fully functioning application by the end of the assignment.

You need to work on your own branch, and are not allowed to push to the master branch directly.

To have your work reviewed, open a pull request from the branch you created. Don't forget to send me the link to your PR after you finish.

Have fun!
